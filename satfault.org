* The Historical Knowledge Base (1985): A 40-year Anniversary.
Revisiting NEXPERT historical demonstration knowledge-base.

For a couple of years, and at least until /Nexpert Object/ was released, the so-called ~SATFAULT~ knowledge-base
was the product demonstration workhorse. It contributed significantly to the early success of the company on the then new and expanding AI market on microcomputers and workstations. The theme amplified the high-tech image by bringing together two widespread cultural threads of the triumphant advanced technologies of the eighties: the space-age successes of the NASA -- specifically of the Space Shuttle Program, pre /Challenger/ -- and the rapid adoption of /expert systems/ -- symbolic AI applications pioneered at places like CMU, Stanford and MIT -- in services and in industry.

As a technical artifact, ~SATFAULT~ was primarily used to demonstrate the blending of powerful features and elegant graphical user interface, particularly stunning on the Macintosh introduced barely a year before in 1984. But it was also designed by its authors, Alain T. Rappaport, co-founder, President and Chief Scientist at Neuron Data, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Andr%C3%A9_Boy][Guy A. Boy]], then at NASA Ames, as a "cultural object" for investigation of Human-Computer Interface (HCI), human-centered design and intelligent assistant systems, suggestive of new and innovative usages of expert system technology beyond symbolic knowledge representation.

** Overview: The Space Transportation System (STS)
In the late seventies and early eighties NASA was busy with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Transportation_System][STS program]] envisioned in February 1969, by a Space Task Group, appointed by President Richard Nixon and headed by Vice President Spiro Agnew to recommend human space projects beyond Apollo. NASA appropriated the name for its /Space Shuttle Program/, the only component of the proposal to survive Congressional funding approval.

The purpose of the system was two-fold:
  * to reduce the cost of spaceflight by replacing the existing method of launching capsules on expendable rockets with reusable spacecraft; and
  * to support ambitious follow-on programs including permanent orbiting space stations around Earth and the Moon, and a human landing mission to Mars.

As a result of funding constraints, Shuttle was significantly scaled back from its planned degree of reusability. The overall program scheduled was also delayed. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program#Program_history][The Shuttle first flew in 1981, and was retired in 2011]].

** NASA actively seeked support for the Shuttle program
In the early eighties, NASA was actively involved in seeking industrial and financial support for the budget-constrained Shuttle program. As reviewed at the [[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19880001489/downloads/19880001489.pdf][Space Construction Conference, December 1986]] by G.M. Levin:

#+begin_quote
In October 1983 the Office of Space Flight at NASA Headquarters
established a new program office to: undertake a series of
developments which would support program objectives of the Office of
Space Flight; give younger NASA engineers "hands on" experience with
the development of flight hardware; lead to new business for the Space
Transportation System (STS); and stimulate present customers of the
STS towards more efficient use of the unique capabilities of the space
shuttle. The Flight Demonstration Program was initiated by undertaking
the development of six demonstrations. The first of these
demonstrations, the Orbital Refueling System was successfully flown on
STS 41-C on August 29, 1984.  The second and third Flight
Demonstrations, EASE and ACCESS, were performed successfully on STS
61-B on November 29 and December l, 1985.
#+end_quote

As detailed in this prospective report, other planned demonstrations were a voice control system for the shuttle's closed circuit television system, an infrared intercommunications system, a plasma motor/generator proof of function demonstration, the implementation of a force feedback device on the shuttle's remote manipulator system, the transfer of super fluid helium on orbit, a laser docking sensor and a small expendable deployment system.

Typical areas of emphasis for Flight Demonstrations were:
  * Space Construction/Large Space Structure
  * Expendable Resupply
  * System Improvement
  * Satellite Servicing
  * Tether Applications

Note that some, if not all, of these broad objectives are still valid and [[https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/space-force-picks-up-pace-of-on-orbit-refueling-experiments/][of interest today]] even though undergoing a changing field and different business model. The Orbital Refueling System (ORS) is particularly significant here.

** The ORS Flight Demonstration: STS-41G
#+begin_quote
The Orbital Refueling System was the first Flight Demonstrations Program
sponsored by the Office of Space Flight.
develop and demonstrate the equipment and procedures for a hydrazine fuel
transfer system; to develop and demonstrate the tools needed to interface with
existing satellites to accomplish fuel transfer; and to developand evaluate
specific procedures to refuel present satellites of the Landsat type.

The ORS consisted of five major categories: the structural subsystem;
the fluid subsystem; the avionics subsystem; the thermal control subsystem;
and the EVA tools. The ORS tankage unit (with its fuel tanks, piping,
valving, heaters, and avionics) was mounted on a Mission Peculiar Experiment
Support Structure (MPESS) in the cargo bay of the orbiter. In the
demonstration configuration the ORS was capable of multiple transfers of
approximately 200 pounds of hydrazine fuel. The ORS could be modified to
deliver approximately 500pounds of fuel to an orbiting satellite by a fuel
line connected with a hydrazine servicing interface toolset.The ORS was
interfaced to the Orbiter general purpose computer,and analog channels were
available for data monitoring. Control of the ORS fuel transfer was from the
Aft Flight Deck. During the ORS demonstration fuel was transferred througha
fixed propellant bypass as well as through a fuel line connection established
by an EVA crew member.

The EVA tools were the unique hardware items required to: permit access
to the manual fill valve; provide redundant seals for crew safety; and control
fluid flow to the satellite.The toolset consisted of seven items designed
for satellite engagement,valve opening,and valve closing. The fuel transfer
unit and valve,once engaged,became permanently attached to the satellite,
thus providing a standard interface for refueling.

The Orbital Refueling System (ORS), managed by NASA’s Johnson Space
Center in Houston, while not directly an Earth observation payload the
primary one in the STS-41G flight, assessed the feasibility of
on-orbit refueling of the Landsat-4 remote sensing satellite, then
under consideration as a mission in 1987, as well as Department of
Defense satellites not designed for on-orbit refueling. In the
demonstration, the astronauts remotely controlled the transfer of
hydrazine, a highly toxic fuel, between two tanks mounted in the
payload bay. During a spacewalk, two crew members simulated connecting
the refueling system to a satellite and later tested the connection
with another remotely controlled fuel transfer.

During the mission components of Orbital Refueling System were connected in an EVA by Kathryn Sullivan and David Leestma on October 11, 1984 (3h 29m), demonstrating that it is possible to refuel satellites in orbit.
The Orbital Refueling System experiment was a demonstration of Shuttle-human-tended capabilities to refuel already orbiting satellites once their self-contained thruster systems have depleted fuel reserves. This demonstration was a precursor to actual Shuttle refueling missions for satellites.

For the final fuel transfer stage, mission specialists David Leestma and Kathryn Sullivan donned their spacesuits and proceed to the aft end of the payload bay where the ORS equipment was mounted on an MPESS (Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structure) along with the Large Format Camera. There the crewmembers opened the tool kit and removed the hydrazine servicing tool - which was already be hooked up to the fuel supply tank. The crewmembers connected it to the ground fill panel of a simulated satellite panel, thus completing the fuel supply link. After pressure checking the hookup, the crewmembers returned to the cabin.

The actual transfer of the hydrazine, which is a very toxic and corrosive material, was controlled from the aft flight deck experiment control panels. The ORS was equipped with sensors which provide pressure and temperature values and switch and valve positions.

One of the important findings of ORS was the heating of pressurant gas behind the bladder. It turned out the transfer rate was limited by a desire to keep temperatures from reaching the decomposition temperature of hydrazine (200 F). The transfer process was controlled to limit ullage gas temperatures to 150 F. Kauffam 37 gives a detailed analysis and post flight reconciliation to the test data. Unfortunately the ORS instrumentation was limited to one temperature sensor for each tank mounted on the sidewall external to the tank so actual ullage gas temperatures are unknown. (See review of the later state of the art in [[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20000121212/downloads/20000121212.pdf][Technologies for Refueling Spacecraft On-Orbit]], by David J. Chato published in 2000.)

** The Landsat refueling system
As for the [[https://www.eoportal.org/satellite-missions/landsat-4-5#spacecraft][Landsat-4]], which orbital refueling was envisioned by the OSF, it was an experimental earth resources monitoring system with the new powerful remote-sensing capabilities of the thematic mapper (TM), and it provided a transition for both foreign and domestic users from the multispectral scanner (MSS) data to the higher resolution and data rate of the TM. It had a complete end-to-end highly automated data system, which was designed to be a new generation system, and was a major step forward in global remote-sensing applications. The [[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1982-072A][Landsat-4]] mission consisted of an orbiting satellite (flight segment) with the necessary wideband data links and support systems, and a ground segment. The Landsat 4 flight segment consisted of two major systems:

  * the instrument module, containing the instruments together with the mission unique subsystems, such as the solar array and drive, the TDRS antenna, the wide-band module (WBM), and the global positioning system (GPS);
  * and the multimission modular spacecraft (MMS) that contained the modularized and standardized power, propulsion, attitude control, and communications and data handling subsystems.

#+caption: Landsat-4 and 5 spacecraft
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
[[./img/LS4_5.jpg]]

The flight segment was designed with 3 years nominal lifetime in orbit and could be extended through in-orbit replacement capability when the Space Shuttle became operational. The spacecraft was placed into an orbit having a descending node equatorial crossing between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m. local time. The spacecraft and attendant sensors were operated through the GSTDN stations before the Tracking And Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) was available. Landsat 4 was decommissioned on 15 June 2001.

As recently as April 2024, USGS reviewed the status of the current Landsat-7 to Landsat-9 missions and gave indication that Landsat-7 (1999-2024), recently lowered into lower storage, orbit was awaiting [[https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/article/osam-1-proving-satellite-servicing-starting-with-landsat-7/][OSAM-1]] satellite rendezvous and refueling (est. 2026).

And as this is written [[https://interestingengineering.com/space/china-refuels-satellites-in-earths-orbit][China’s satellites may have pulled off world’s first in-orbit fuel refill, beating US]] turning ORS up to a power fight for geostrategic dominance.
    
** HORSES
The original knowledge-base development was inspired by Boy's work at NASA Ames on [[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19880014770/downloads/19880014770.pdf][Fault Diagnosis In Orbital Refueling Operations]], a paper presented at the /Space Station Human Factors Research Review/, NASA Ames Research
Center, December 1985. Thus clearly positioned within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research, the /expert system/ approach pionneered here was a stepping stone to later /intelligent assistant systems/ research:

#+begin_quote
Usually, operation manuals are provided for helping astronauts during space
operations. These manuals include normal and malfunction procedures.
Transferring operation manual knowledge into a computerized form is not a
trivial task. This knowledge is generally written by designers or operation
engineers, and is often quite different from the user logic. The latter is usually a
"compiled" version of the former. Experiments are in progress to assess the user
logic. HORSES (Human - Orbital Refueling System - Expert System) is an
attempt to include both of these logics in the same tool. It is designed to assist
astronauts during monitoring and diagnosis tasks. Basically, HORSES includes a
situation recognition level coupled to an analytical diagnoser, and a meta-level
working on both of the previous levels. HORSES is a good tool for modeling task
models and is also more broadly useful for knowledge design.
#+end_quote

So the topic is the study of Human-Computer-System tri-partite interactions in "normal" and "abnormal" situations. The "system" being in this case the ORS.

#+caption: Landsat-D will utilize the ORS equipment and procedures for propellant replenishment

The so-called /User's Guide Expert System/ drew heavily on modelling approaches and human factors studies to address its objectives of providing an optimal level of automation and levelled explanations all within an easy-to-use interface. It heralded the "seminal HCI" phase proposed by Joelle Coutaz in [fn:1].

On the Macintosh, the transposition of a simplified version of the HORSES expert system, used abundant graphics and images to serve the above objectives.

#+caption: Comparison of visuals. Left schematics from NASA manual. Right screenshot presentation driven by the expert system.

NASA procedure manuals were transposed into expert system's rules used both for diagnosis/situation assessment plus remedies and for explanations.
